"""
game_cache_reader.py — Sovereign FanStack Hot Cache Reader
Node: clio (192.168.1.183)

Provides lightweight, read-only access to the local game state cache
written atomically by fanstack_background_poller.py on every state-hash delta.

INVARIANTS:
  - This module NEVER writes to disk.
  - This module NEVER touches sovereign_now.db or sovereign_intelligence.db.
  - This module NEVER raises exceptions — all failures return safe empty strings.
    Callers live in hot async paths; a crashed reader kills chatbot throughput.
  - All reads are single open-read-close operations. No file handles are held open.
  - Cache files are written with atomic rename by the poller, so partial reads
    are structurally impossible on Linux (rename is atomic on same filesystem).
