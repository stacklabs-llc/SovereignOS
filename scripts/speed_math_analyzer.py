    You are an MLB sports scientist performing kinematic frame analysis.
    The user heavily disputes your previous calculation that Mark Vientos ran 29.61 ft/s, stating he is notoriously slow (comparable to Pete Alonso). 
    
    CRITICAL CONTEXT: The user stated this video clip is only a 7-second snippet showing the VERY END of the play. 
    This means Vientos likely DID NOT start at 3rd base in the footage. He was probably already halfway down the line when the clip began.
    
    Please do the following:
    1. Identify the EXACT timestamp when Vientos first appears clearly running towards home plate.
    2. Identify the EXACT timestamp when he arrives at home plate (or gets tagged out by the catcher).
    3. Calculate the total time elapsed between those two points.
    4. Visually estimate how far down the 3rd base line he was when you first spotted him (e.g., halfway = 45 feet remaining, two-thirds = 30 feet remaining). 
    5. Calculate his average speed in feet per second (ft/s) using this NEW estimated distance.
    6. Compare his newly calculated speed to the MLB average sprint speed of 27 ft/s, taking his known slow build into account.
    
    Give me the raw math. Be highly analytical, acknowledge the truncation of the video, and validate the user's claim that he is painfully slow.
