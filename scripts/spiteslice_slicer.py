The image must be arranged in a perfectly balanced 3x3 grid layout containing exactly 9 clean, standalone 1:1 profile square blocks on an absolute solid black background, with zero text overlays, zero labels, and zero detail circles. Explicit views layout: top row contains three standalone frontal portrait headshots with different intense expressions (glaring in quality audit, laughing mockingly, looking deeply unimpressed); middle row contains three clean side profile views looking left and right; bottom row contains three expressive action poses including pointing a wooden pizza peel forward in rage, slicing a crust with a heavy rocker-blade, and shrugging in exasperation. Gritty woodcut illustration style, raw ink textures, high-contrast shadows, bold neon-crimson border highlights on the figure, premium masterpiece character design."

Explicit views layout: top row contains three standalone frontal portrait headshots with different intense expressions (screaming in entrepreneurial spite, smirking behind binoculars, laughing maniacally at a competitor's crash); middle row contains three clean side profile views looking left and right; bottom row contains three expressive action poses including pointing a finger in condemnation, tossing a raw pizza dough sheet overhead, and shrugging shoulders in total dismissive spite.

The image must be arranged in a perfectly balanced 3x3 grid layout containing exactly 9 clean, standalone 1:1 profile square blocks on an absolute solid black background, with zero text overlays, zero labels, and zero detail circles. Explicit views layout: top row contains three standalone frontal portrait headshots with different intense expressions (scowling at a physical cash register, looking incredibly smug, squinting at a brick oven); middle row contains three clean side profile views looking left and right; bottom row contains three expressive action poses including pointing a finger in commission-fee condemnation, holding up a digital terms-of-service agreement, and shrugging shoulders in corporate superiority. Gritty woodcut illustration style, desaturated slate blue and cold corporate white accents, raw ink textures, sharp clean lines, premium character design."
