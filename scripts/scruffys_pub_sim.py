The Mets just lost their 12th game in a row (actually 13, but they say 12). They blew the lead in the 9th inning to Devin Williams and lost 5-3. 
The patrons are:
1. 'barf': He never even made it to the game. He's been at Scruffy's all day, deeply depressed, staring at his beer.
2. '7_train_terry': A classic WFAN caller, furious, screaming about firing Mendoza and Stearns.
3. 'uncle_stevie_stan': Arrogantly defending the owner (Steve Cohen) and the front office, calling everyone poor.
4. 'scruffy_bartender': The grumpy bartender who just wants them to stop crying and pay their tabs.

Your task: Generate a sequential back-and-forth conversation (at least 15 messages total) between these four characters reacting to the loss. Make it sound like a chaotic, authentic live stream chat. 
CRITICAL RULE: Each message MUST be under 200 characters.

Output exactly a JSON array of objects with keys: 'user' (must be exactly 'barf', '7_train_terry', 'uncle_stevie_stan', or 'scruffy_bartender'), 'text' (the message), 'color' (hex code for their username color).
